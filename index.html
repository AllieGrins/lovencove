              <br>
      I like your eyes, you look away when you pretend not to care,
      <br>
      ~~~~~~~~
      <br><br>

            I laughed along with Justin and Seo-Yoon, making another dirty joke as I hid under the hood of my jacket.
      <br>
            "Ezekiel's still not done no matter what he does!" Justin hollered loudly, slapping his knee and touching his now non-existant hair in an attempt to calm himself down.
      <br>
             Ezekiel's eyes widen and he rolled his eyes, obviously flustered and he looked away, scoffing and crossing his arms beside me but points at Justin. He tries to come up with a good come back but stumbles over his words.
      <br>
           "You don't have anything to get hard! At least I have!" I burst into a fit of giggles, covering my mouth and glancing at him. He smiled triumphantly and looked back at me, he noticed I was looking and got flustered, averting his gaze but his smile made my heart melt.
      <br><br>
      ~~~~~~~~
      <br>
      I like the dimples on the corners of the smile that you wear,
      <br>
      ~~~~~~~~
           <br><br>
            He was shuffling my tarot cards, carefully looking at each one and showing one to me to ask what it meant. As he continued doing this, I stared at him with a small smile, not really believing that we're actually having a peaceful moment like this.
      <br>
            He looked up to ask me what the star meant before noticing I was looking at him. He made eye contact and it suddenly seemed like he was challenging me to who would look away first.
      <br>
            I simply rose my brow and gave a smile and immediately he folded up like a flower, the shy smile that I live seeing appeared on his face, his deep dimples showing, making his face look more appealing.
      <br>
            And making me fall deeper for him.
      <br><br>
      ~~~~~~~~
      <br>
      I like you more,
      the world may know but don't be scared
      Coz I'm falling deeper, baby be prepared
      <br>
      ~~~~~~~~~
      <br><br>
             My heart beat faster as I glance at him one more time. How could I have fallen harder for the same idiot??? My gosh... I paused at my own thought and huffed in amusement.
      <br>
            'You know fully well why.' Thinking to myself, I glanced at him once again, feeling my heart fill with warmth and my stomach raging with butterflies.
      <br>
             'You really still love him...'
      <br><br>
      ~~~~~~~~~
      <br>
      I like your shirt, I like your fingers, love the way that you smell
      <br>
      ~~~~~~~~~
      <br><br>

             "YOOO, look at Kill la kill!" Taylor yelled, pointing at someone behind me as we were waiting at the mall.
      <br>
             We went out and Ezekiel finally agreed to go out with us, and now I tried to look my best, with my best shirt and shorts, my nicest shoes and my hair styled to a T.
      <br>
              Twirling around, I was met with a sight I was NOT expecting.
      <br>
               Ezekiel, standing there, in a white,long-sleeved-but-folded-back polo with his hair normal and him wearing long, black pants with nicely styled shoes.
      <br>
             Who knew someone could look so simple but so handsome...
      <br>
            I was left slack jaw and gaping like a fish out of water as I stared at him in shock.  And when he went to stand beside me, I got a huge whiff of his natural scent. It wasn't bad smelling body odor, it was just his normal scent and I would always go crazy when I smell him.
      <br><br>
      ~~~~~~~~
      <br>
      To be your favorite jacket just so I could always be near
      <br>
      ~~~~~~~~
      <br><br>
            I shivered in the cold, being stuck in the rain with Ezekiel. Our friends left us to get hypothermia probably, not giving back the umbrella even for a split second because lunch assembly started. Thankfully, there was a small shade we could both fit in but it was still cold, as I had forgotten to bring my jacket with me.
      <br>
             I sat in a somewhat crouched position, my skirt and pretty much see through blouse was soaked to the bone, the breeze brushing past me easily and sending a shiver down my spine.
      <br>
            Suddenly, I felt something warm and somewhat dry being draped around my shoulders, the sudden warmth giving me a sense of relief and comfort but I looked at the source. Ezekiel was sitting beside me with his shirt completely dry from being protected and his gaze averted from me.
      <br>
            "Zeke, it's ok, you're gonna get cold-" I started in a worried tone, only to be shut up when out of nowhere, he wrapped his arms around me tightly, his warmth radiating off him like a heater.
      <br>
            My cheeks flared up, acting as heaters as well as I've never felt his body this close to mine.
      <br>
            "it's ok. They said if you hug someone, you'll be able to stay warm, so I'm fine." Without a complaint, I simply smiled and snuggled close to him. Finally.
      <br><br>
      ~~~~~~~~
      <br>
      I've loved you for so long,
      sometimes it's hard to bare.
      But after all this time,
      I hope you wait and see.
      <br>
      ~~~~~~~~
      <br><br>
              I reminisced in all the times we were really close, smiling softly as I glanced over at him.
      <br>
            He wrote on his notebook with a serious face, his eyebrows furrowed and his mouth pursed.
      <br><br>
            Someday, he'll know how much I like him.

          <p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

          <br><br>

          The sound of thunder rumbled, it's sound making a small 6 year old girl with brown hair and bright green eyes, which filled were with fear.

          <br><br>

          She sat trembling in her bed, slightly rocking herself to calm her frantically beating heart while her Nessie stuffed toy was in her tiny arms.

          <br><br>

          Soon, lightning flashed through the window, the sudden cracking sound sent the girl shrieking with big, fat tears escaping her eyes as she jostled around her blanket and escaped the warm bed's grasp.

          <br><br>

          Her bear feet padded across the wooden floors, her wails of terror echoing through the quiet house.

          <br><br>

          Her shaky breaths hitched when she saw the door of her parents close by and she quickly dashed towards it. Once she arrived, she fumbled with the gold door knob and immediately entered.

          <br><br>

          There, in the bed, lay two sleeping figures. The girl's father, Allistor and her mother, Lorelei. Allistor's left arm was used as a pillow by the brown haired female, his right arm draped around her tiny waist tightly as her own arms were wrapped around his built form, her head resting on the Scott's chest.

          <br><br>

          "Mamaidh! Dhadaidh!" Both shot up almost immediately and their eyes landed on their trembling daughter, tightly clinging to the tear soaked Nessie toy.

          <br><br>

          Your tired eyes soften and a soft smile spread across your lips, opening your arms wide.

          <br><br>

          "Awww, my baby girl, come here. It's Ok, mommy and daddy is here~." Avory scrambled up to the bed and jumped into your arms, a piece of your night gown bundled up in her small hands.

          <br><br>

          Allistor scooted over closer and hugged the both of you.

          <br><br>

          "Awww, what's wrong, me wee fox? Did somethin' hurt yeh?" Ava shook her head gently.

          <br><br>

          "Allistor, it's because of the lightning and thunder. She's afraid of it, remember?" The door opened again but instead, in came a boy with fiery red hair, rubbing his blue eyes sleepily and his other hand held the door knob open.

          <br><br>

          "Mum? Dad? What happened? I heard screamin'." His eyes then widen when he saw his baby sister glancing at him from your chest.

          <br><br>

          "It be alright, Fergus. Yer sister got scared of the lightnin'." The 8 year old scurried over to his father's side and nuzzled his sister sweetly.

          <br><br>

          "Don't be scared, me wee darlin'. It be nothin' compared to mum an' dad!" Ava gave a small grin.

          <br><br>

          "Yeah! The mean lightning isn't gonna hurt us, right mommy, daddy?" Allistor grinend and ruffled the thick locks of his son and daughter, giving a sweet kiss to you while you just laughed it off.

          <br><br>

          "That's right, Fergus, Ava. Yer mum an' I can make quuiiite an earthquake, ain't that right, lass?" Allistor said with a smirk and wink, making your cheeks flush bright red and you smacked his arm.

          <br><br>

          "Allistor!" He gave a chuckle and turned back to the kids.

          <br><br>

          "How about I sing you to sleep?" You offered, hugging your daughter.

          <br><br>

          "Yes please!" They both laid in the middle, blanket over them snuggly, eager to hear their mother's beautiful singing voice.

          <br><br><br>

          <i>"A naoidhean bhig, cluinn mo ghuth

          Mise ri d' thaobh, Ó mhaighdean bhàn

          Ar rìbhinn òg, fàs a's faic

          Do thìr, dìleas fhéin

          Mhaighdean uasal bhàn~."

          </i>

          <br><br><br>

          You glanced at your children and smiled at how fast they slept. Allistor grinned at you and kissed your soft lips with his slightly chapped ones, filled with passion and love.

          <br><br>

          The kiss lasted for a few moments before you two parted, breathless but with a smile. Scotland pecked you again and held your cheek tenderly with his large hands.

          <br><br>

          "I never thought I would ever be yer' husband, me love. You're just too perfect for me." He said with a dreamy sigh escaping his lips.

          <br><br>

          "Oh, Allistor. I would give anything just to be with you."

          <br><br>

          "Aye, me wee lamb." He kissed your forehead tenderly, along with Fergus' and (D/N)'s cheek and nestled around all of you like a protective mama bear looking out for its cubs.

          <br><br>

          "Thank you for givin' me such a wonderful and beautiful family." Allistor added before sleep invaded him.

          <br><br>

          Little did they know, a glowing blue fire of some sort watched over them through the window, smiling as it continued guarding them. A Willow-The-Wisp. Their guardian Angel.
